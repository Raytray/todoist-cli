# todoist-cli

If I have time for it, I will expand to hit the other endpoints. But for now, this was merely an hour long adventure to allow me to quickly add tasks to todoist from the commandline.  

You are required to have a .todoist.cfg file in your home directory storing the token and default project name. This is in the format of:

```
[DEFAULT]
TOKEN = GetTokenFromYourTodoistSettings
DEFAULT_PROJECT_NAME = YourProjectNameHere
```
